    <p><q>I had a lovely trip! It was beautifl weather, the beaches were amazing, and the food was delicious. The sunsets here are amzing, and I hope to come back again.</q></p>
    
    <p><q>Our trip was incredible! Our first time in Africa and our first trip of this extent and we couldn't be happier. We had the perfect combination of safari, tent, beach, hotel and enjoyment.</q></p>
    
    <p><q>I think overall we liked Tanzania and Zanzibar better than Botswana and the Seychelles. However, it is like comparing apples to oranges. We have been fortunate in that we have been to Africa before and it is hard not to compare trips. Definitely flying from camp to camp is the way to go.</q></p>
